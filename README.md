## About Vdes

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Vdes framework. If you want to build an application using Vdes, visit the main [Vdes repository](https://github.com/vdes/vdes).

Vdes is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Vdes attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://vdes.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://vdes.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://vdes.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://vdes.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://vdes.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://vdes.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://vdes.com/docs/broadcasting).

Vdes is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation gives you a complete toolset required to build any application with which you are tasked.
